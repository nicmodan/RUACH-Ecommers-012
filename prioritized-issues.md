# Prioritized Issues

## High Priority (Must Fix)
1. **Inconsistent Contact Information**
   - Issue: Different pages use different email addresses (support@ruachestore.com vs support@ruachestore.com.ng)
   - Impact: Customer confusion and potential loss of communication
   - Recommendation: Standardize to one email address across all pages

2. **Disabled Payment Integration**
   - Issue: Stripe payment integration is temporarily disabled
   - Impact: Limited payment options for customers
   - Recommendation: Re-enable Stripe integration or implement alternative payment solutions

## Medium Priority (Should Fix)
3. **Image Placeholders**
   - Issue: Some components still use placeholder images instead of actual product images
   - Impact: Poor user experience and reduced trust
   - Recommendation: Implement proper error handling for image loading and use actual product images

4. **Form Validation**
   - Issue: Some forms lack comprehensive validation
   - Impact: Potential for incorrect data submission
   - Recommendation: Add more robust form validation with clear error messages

5. **Loading States**
   - Issue: Some components could benefit from better loading states
   - Impact: Poor user experience during data fetching
   - Recommendation: Implement skeleton loaders or loading indicators for better UX

## Low Priority (Nice to Have)
6. **Content Consistency**
   - Issue: Minor inconsistencies in messaging across pages
   - Impact: Slightly reduced brand consistency
   - Recommendation: Review and standardize messaging across all pages

7. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Issue: Some components could be more accessible
   - Impact: Reduced usability for users with disabilities
   - Recommendation: Add proper ARIA labels and improve keyboard navigation
