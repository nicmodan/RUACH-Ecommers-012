# Firebase Setup for Ayotayo E-commerce

This document provides instructions on how to set up Firebase for the Ayotayo e-commerce project.

## Prerequisites

1. A Google account
2. Node.js and npm installed on your computer

## Step 1: Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click on "Add project"
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "Ayotayo-Ecommerce")
4. Choose whether to enable Google Analytics (recommended)
5. Accept the terms and click "Create project"
6. Wait for the project to be created, then click "Continue"

## Step 2: Register Your Web App

1. On the Firebase project dashboard, click on the web icon (</>) to add a web app
2. Enter a nickname for your app (e.g., "Ayotayo Web")
3. Optionally, check "Also set up Firebase Hosting"
4. Click "Register app"
5. Copy the Firebase configuration object (you'll need this for your `.env` file)

## Step 3: Enable Authentication Methods

1. In the Firebase console, go to "Authentication" in the left sidebar
2. Click on "Get started" if prompted
3. Enable the following authentication methods:
   - Email/Password: Click on it, switch the "Enable" toggle, and click "Save"
   - Google: Click on it, switch the "Enable" toggle, provide a support email, and click "Save"

## Step 4: Set Up Firestore Database

1. In the Firebase console, go to "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose either "Start in production mode" or "Start in test mode" (Note: test mode allows open access for 30 days)
4. Select a location for your database (choose one close to your target audience)
5. Click "Enable"

## Step 5: Configure Storage Rules

1. In the Firebase console, go to "Storage" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Get started" if prompted
3. For now, you can keep the default rules or modify them based on your needs
4. Click "Next" and "Done"

## Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

1. In the root of your project, create or edit the `.env` file (if it doesn't exist already)
2. Add the following environment variables with your Firebase project details:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

Replace each value with the corresponding values from your Firebase configuration.

## Step 7: Install Firebase SDK

If you haven't already installed the Firebase SDK, run:

```bash
npm install firebase
```

## Step 8: Test Your Setup

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Try to register a new user and log in
3. Check the Firebase console to verify that the user was created

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**: Make sure the authentication methods are enabled in Firebase.
- **Database Permission Errors**: Check your Firestore security rules.
- **Storage Issues**: Verify your Storage security rules.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure your `.env` file has all the required variables and that they're correctly formatted.
